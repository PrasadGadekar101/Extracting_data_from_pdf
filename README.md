# Extracting_data_from_pdf
Working with a project where the data is present in the form of pdf, so it becomes necessary to extract it into excel or csv which can be used for further analysis.

- results pdf is from the pune university(Maharashtra, India) so same code can be used with some small modification for extraction of marks of othe department which are from same university.

NOTE : the data is posted here with the permission of the one to whom it belongs.
